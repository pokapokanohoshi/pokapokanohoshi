- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pokapokanohoshi from China, but my ID "pokapokanohoshi" in Japanese means "warm stars" in English.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in painting, coding, Japanese...
- â™ª I love to listen to [Harumaki Gohan](https://harumakigohan.com/)'s music
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, js, css. Maybe typescript later.
